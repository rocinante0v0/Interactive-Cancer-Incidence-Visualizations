# Interactive Cancer Incidence Visualizations

This project presents an interactive dashboard that visualizes colorectal cancer incidence patterns across Georgia counties. It includes both a scatter plot and a choropleth map to support exploratory spatial and demographic analysis.

## Background and Objective

Colorectal cancer is a major public health concern with geographic and demographic variation. The goal of this dashboard is to help identify population-level patterns in cancer incidence rates, using county-level data from Georgia. It provides insight into how incidence relates to population size, and highlights potential regional hotspots that warrant further investigation.

## Features

- Interactive scatter plot showing incidence rate vs. total population
- Interactive map showing county-level incidence variation
- Hover tooltips for both visualizations
- Responsive layout for web viewing

## Technologies Used

- R + R Markdown
- `plotly` for interactive scatter plot
- `leaflet` for choropleth map
- `dplyr`, `sf`, `htmltools`, and `tmap` for data wrangling and visualization
